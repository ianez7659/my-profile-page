## Web Animation as a Personal Interest

Today, I’d like to introduce a personal project I recently added to my portfolio website—one that makes extensive use of GSAP.

I’ve always been interested in effects and animations used on the web, and I’ve spent a lot of time experimenting and having fun with CSS and SCSS. More recently, I’ve been using Framer Motion quite often because of how easy it is to work with.

However, what impressed me most when I encountered GSAP was how it enables much more sophisticated page choreography through its timeline-based approach.

      <h3>Cinematic Page Choreography with GSAP</h3>
      <p className="text-blue-950">
        In particular, GSAP really shines when it comes to stitching multiple elements together like cinematic cuts, or revealing text and logos sequentially with a strong sense of rhythm. It has a kind of tactile, hands-on feel that sets it apart from other animation libraries.

      <h3>From Concept to Experiment</h3>
      <p className="text-blue-950">
        This project started from a desire to directly explore and implement those strengths of GSAP. I began working on it with the idea: “What if a famous animation and game series like Initial D were reimagined as a web-based game with this kind of visual style?”

        From a technical standpoint, the project uses a somewhat unconventional combination—GSAP at the core, along with TypeScript, Astro, and Express. Despite being experimental, it turned out to be an especially enjoyable experience for me.

## What This Project Represents

In the end, I believe this project best demonstrates both the fun and the expressive potential of page animations built with GSAP.

At its current stage, the project implements only the core features, such as a simple dashboard after login, a profile page, and basic messaging functionality.
Moving forward, I plan to expand this project into a space similar to an online game lobby—where users can naturally gather, wait, and interact with one another in real time.
