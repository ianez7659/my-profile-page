## Introduction

This is a post about the portfolio page I've created, introductions to my personal projects, school-related news, and my personal interests.

## About the Portfolio Page

- The current portfolio page was created to introduce myself and my personal projects.
- The tech stack used is Next.js, and the layout and styling are handled with TailwindCSS.
- I will now briefly explain the overall purpose of this blog.

      <h3>Behind the Code: My Personal Projects</h3>
      <p className="text-blue-950">
        I plan to use this blog page to post introductions to my personal
        projects and behind-the-scenes stories about their development. I will
        be posting new articles whenever a project is completed, so please stay
        tuned.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>Purpose of Sharing School-Related News</h3>
      <p className="text-blue-950 text-lg">
        My personal hope is that by posting various events and announcements
        from the school here, I can help a little with the school's promotion.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Miscellaneous Talk on Personal Interests</h3>
      <p className="text-blue-950 text-lg">
        Lastly, I also plan to occasionally discuss personal interests and
        tech-related topics within this blog.
