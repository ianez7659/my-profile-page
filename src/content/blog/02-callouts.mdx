# Brief Introduction of MDX

All blog posts are made with **MDX**. I want to intoroduce some types of callout components we can use in this blog:

<Callout type="tip">
  ### Type: tip

This is my first callout component with tip. The style is controlled by MDX style commands like "#" and "##".

</Callout>
<br />
<Callout type="info">
  {
    <>
      <h3>Type: info</h3>
      <p className="text-blue-950">
        This is my 2nd Callout component with info type! This is an example that
        demonstrates how you can structure paragraphs in a Callout using not
        only MDX styling, but also by directly using JSX and CSS. .
      </p>
    </>
  }
  ![Sample](/images/me.jpg)
  {
    <>
      <p className="text-blue-950">
        Also, as you can see the image, you can even bring images inside of
        callout component.
      </p>
    </>
  }
</Callout>
<br />
<Callout type="warn">
  {
    <>
      <h3>Type: warn</h3>
      <p className="text-yellow-950">
        This is my 3rd Callout component using warn! As you can see, all the
        types are distinguished by color, so you can freely use the callout type
        that fits your purpose.
      </p>
    </>
  }
</Callout>

## More about MDX style layout

- MDX structures using "-"
- Inserting Custom components
- Tailwind + prose Style
- Of course, these features are all made by MDX style commands

<br />
## Insert Images

Lastly, I want to show an image on the page itself.
